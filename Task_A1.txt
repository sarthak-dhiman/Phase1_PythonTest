# pyenv vs venv


venv is an isolated python virtual environment.it is an inbuilt module of python , and it helps -
1) to manage dependencies of each project seprately 
2) avoids system wide conficts
3) advisable to have  a virtual environment for each python project

whereas pyenv is a module which is used to manage multiple python versions.
used where the code needs to be validated on diff python installation versions.
should be used inside a venv as it may cause global conflicts otherwise
